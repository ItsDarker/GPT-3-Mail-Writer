# GPT-3-Mail-Writer
Python to write mail by prompt using gpt-3 API


The code structure saves the generated content as a plain text file using the save_as_text_file() function instead of using the python-docx library.

After running the code, it will prompt you to enter the prompt for the email. The code will generate the email content using the GPT-3 API and save it as a plain text file named 'email.txt'. You can modify the output filename as needed.

Remember to replace 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key and ensure that you have the OpenAI Python package installed (pip install openai).
